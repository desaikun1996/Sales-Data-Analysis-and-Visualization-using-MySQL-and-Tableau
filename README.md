# Sales Data Analysis and Visualization using MySQL and Tableau
 Worked on Sales Data of a private firm in India. Captured various insights about the data, pre-processed and cleansed it, and finally showcased useful and decisive visualizations using charts and dashboards. For initial data analysis and data cleaning, I have used MySQL Workbench and further loaded the cleansed data into Tableau for visualizations. These visualizations can be further used by the Sales Director to make relevant business decisions and changes.
